# Hi there, I'm Lukasz 👋

I'm the creator of [www.howtofocus.info](https://www.howtofocus.info)

In a world increasingly dominated by the AI goldrush, a relentless flood of content, self-proclaimed gurus, social media, and digital noise, I've made it my mission to bring people the gift of **focus**, **attention**, and **momentary calmness**. And for those struggling with distractions, I aim to offer an opportunity and a fighting chance to achieve just a little bit more.

If even **1 in 10,000** people who visit my project step away from distractions and regain their mental clarity for a moment, I will consider my mission a success. And if that momentary focus can be turned into a first milestone that pivots them towards a better place in life they can be, I hope it helps them—and through them, their loved ones, a friend, a family member, or even a stranger. Then, we might just start a ripple that changes lives.
