# Hi there, I'm Lukasz 👋

A tech enthusiast since childhood, I’m passionate about software development and IT. After over a decade in another industry, I followed my calling to create human-centered technology and tools that save time, help people stay focused, connected to their values and make the world better.

Now I am saving the world in my own way — one line of code at a time.

In a world increasingly dominated by the AI goldrush, a relentless flood of content, self-proclaimed gurus, social media, and digital noise, I've made it my mission to bring people the gift of **focus**, **attention**, and **momentary calmness**. And for those struggling with distractions, I aim to offer an opportunity and a fighting chance to achieve just a little bit more.

If even **1 in 10,000** people who visit my projects step away from distractions and regain their mental clarity for a moment, I will consider my mission a success. And if that momentary focus can be turned into a first milestone that pivots them towards a better place in life they can be, I hope it helps them—and through them, their loved ones, a friend, a family member, or even a stranger. Then, we might just start a ripple that changes lives.

### 🔭 What I'm Up To

#### 🚀 Currently Building & Designing

- ✨ **Thou Art - Daily Affirmations App** — A single-page web application displaying daily affirmations with interactive animations and audio feedback, designed to provide a rewarding and conditioning experience. The roadmap includes a mobile app with push notifications, gamification elements, gacha-style mechanics, and social media-inspired algorithms optimized for user benefit rather than advertisement-driven engagement.
- 🧠 **howtofocus.info** — A distraction-free mental preparation tool for cognitively demanding tasks.
- 📊 **Personal Trading Dashboard** — Visualizing and consolidating multi-platform investment portfolios.
- 🧾 **UK Business Tax Deadline Tracker** — A web app to help UK businesses manage accounting and Corporation Tax deadlines.
- 🤖 **AI Investment Analyst (or AI FinBro Agent)** — An AI agent that conducts market research for investment portfolios and delivers daily updates.



#### ✅ Completed Projects & Maintenance 

- 💻 [codebase-extractor](https://github.com/lukaszlekowski/codebase-extractor) — A command-line tool that scans your project directory and extracts source code into well-structured Markdown files. It’s perfect for creating complete, organized snapshots of projects—especially for analysis, documentation, or providing context to Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Gemini, or Claude. Features include interactive folder selection, smart filtering, configurable scan depth, and YAML metadata in outputs[1].
- 🚚 **[trimsontransport.com](https://trimsontransport.com)** — A WordPress-based website for a UK transport company, self-hosted and managed on a cloud instance running Ubuntu Linux and standard LAMP stack.
- 😂 **Bad Joke Reset Button** — A fun web app for those moments when a joke falls flat. Hit the button to 'erase' the awkwardness, track the global 'resets', and enjoy some curated jokes and quotes. Started as a joke between friends and turnedout to be a fun little project.
